abstract="A race condition is a situation where two threads manipulate a data structure simultaneously, without synchronization. Race conditions are common errors in multithreaded programming. They often lead to unintended nondeterminism and wrong results. Moreover, they are notoriously hard to diagnose, and attempts to eliminate them can introduce deadlocks. In practice, race conditions and deadlocks are often avoided through prudent programming discipline: protecting each shared data structure with a lock and imposing a partial order on lock acquisitions. In this paper we show that this discipline can be captured (if not completely, to a significant extent) through a set of static rules. We present these rules as a type system for a concurrent, imperative language. Although weaker than a full-blown program-verification calculus, the type system is effective and easy to apply. We emphasize a core, first-order type system focused on race conditions; we also consider extensions with polymorphism, existential types, and a partial order on lock types.",
